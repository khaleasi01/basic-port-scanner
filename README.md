# You can create your own port scanner with python. With which you can find open ports in your targeted ip address.
# The simple logic behind building a ports scanner is: 
 #             > a loop that can define a of range the ports.
 #             > socket library in python which has some inbuilt functions
 #             > and basic python syntax
